      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When you want to remodel your basement or your home what do you usually do? You grab a paper to draw and try to explain to your partner hoping he/she will visualize what you are planning to do. Does this work all the time? Probably not. That is where I come in. I create the blueprint of your house giving you a better idea of what your remodel will look like in the area you want to improve. I give different options with prices of the type of work you will like for your space with design of furniture and elevation in 3D. You will have the option on my website to select what part of your space you would like to see as a 3D model. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience are local homeowners or realtors who are looking to upgrade either a small or bigger area of their house or investment. Trying to visualize an idea and share with others is difficult and can cause stress for the homeowner and family, causing delays in the remodeling process. I will try to make this website friendly and simple so everyone from different ages and backgrounds can understand what we are offering and have access from different devices. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
