    <h2>Hi, my name is Esteban Sarmiento</h2>
    <p align="justify">I am from Lima-Peru, but currently living in Utah. 
        I just switched from General Studies to Applied Technology.
         Thankfully the classes that I already took will remain as credits. 
         I work as a medical assistant and have a side job as an architectural drafter. 
         I really enjoy working on my computer for both jobs. 
         So far coding has been really interesting and enjoyable. 
         I am looking forward to knowing my peer students and keep getting more knowledge from this class. For hobbies I like to do some carpentry work and if the time and weather allows, I like to drive up to the mountains, hike, and camp. </p>
